            The importance of morality to administration cannot be underplayed. This is because administration has to 
            do with getting things done; with the accomplishment of defined objectives. It is the organization and use of 
            men and materials to accomplish a purpose. On the basis of this, morality as the principle guiding the 
            behaviours of managers and the men working with them become very important. Without morality, there 
            could be cases of abuse of power, privileges and office by the managers. Also, the employees within civil 
            service could also indulge in unethical activities. Thus, moral ethos becomes a necessary apparatus in guiding 
            the workers and their managers in order to ensure a friendly and effective working condition.
